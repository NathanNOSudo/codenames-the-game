Using what I learned in Azam's Awesome class to build awesome apps.

Currently, the game requires all players to be around the same computer.
 Click the icon to start/reveal the team words to the Codemasters, this game is new to me im learning as I go feel free to offer advice.


Features Needed for Project requirements:

- More words to choose from
- Add websockets so people can play online together
- Find a more elegant solution to communicate each team's words to the Codemaster. Maybe highlight the words?
- More feedback in the CM view to see what words have been selected

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
